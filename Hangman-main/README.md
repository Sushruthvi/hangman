# Hangman - Guess Cities Name

This is a Hangman game where you have to guess the names of various cities. The game presents you with a city name with some letters missing, and you have to guess the missing letters one by one. You have limited chances to guess the correct word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `main()` function in the provided Python script.
2. The game will start with a front page where you can click on the "Start" button to begin playing.
3. Once the game starts, you will see a word with some letters missing represented by dashes.
4. Click on the letters displayed on the screen to guess them. If the letter is correct, it will replace the corresponding dash(es) in the word. Otherwise, the hangman drawing will progress.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or run out of chances.
6. If you complete the word within the given number of chances, you win. Otherwise, you lose the game.
